# Machine Learning Model Optimization

## Description

This project involves a comprehensive approach to machine learning model optimization. The workflow includes meticulous Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), one-hot encoding, manual feature selection, and feature scaling to enhance model performance. Various algorithms were applied, including Logistic Regression, ensemble methods, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Hyperparameters were tuned using GridSearchCV, achieving an accuracy of 0.8432.

## Features
